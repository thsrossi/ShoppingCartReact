## Overview

The Shopping Cart App is an e-commerce application that allows users to view items, add them to their cart, and complete a purchase. The app uses ReactJS with Context API for state management and Tailwind for styling.

### The challenge

The challenge was to build a functional shopping cart app that allows users to add and remove items from their cart, adjust quantities, and complete a purchase.

## My Process

The project was built using a mobile-first workflow, starting with the design and layout of the app for mobile devices and then scaling up to larger screen sizes.

I began by creating the basic structure of the app using ReactJS and Context API for state management. I then implemented the cart functionality, allowing users to add and remove items and adjust quantities. 

My JSON Server was used to create the fake REST API used in this project. It allowed for quick and easy prototyping and testing of the app's functionality without needing to set up a real API.

### Built With

ReactJS - JavaScript library for building user interfaces <br/>
Context API - State management tool in React <br/>
Tailwind - CSS framework for styling <br/>
Stripe - Payment processing gateway <br/>
[My JSON Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com) - Fake online REST API for prototyping and testing

### What I Learned
Through this project, I deepened my knowledge of ReactJS and gained experience using Context API for state management. I also improved my CSS skills using Tailwind for styling.
